                    I have been a software engineer for a while now.  I originally learned Assembler and moved 
                    towards C and C++ while working in the mobile phone industry.  
                    After some time I adapted my skills in the Java arena and have worked with Java in the financial 
                    services space for some time now.  At this point I am trying to learn Fullstack and do a horizontal 
                    career change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from work, I have always enjoyed keeping myself fit through consistent workouts and 
                    (mostly) good eating habits.  I enjoy cooking spicy and delicous foods.  I also enjoy eating out 
                    on occasion and adapting those styles into my own cooking.  My preferred workouts include weight 
                    training at a club and cycling outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy traveling and learning from other cultures as well.   
                </p>
                <p>I am also super handy and have completely remodeled a home from top to bottom.  This was a challenging 
                    project.  Prior to taking on this project I had done some electrical work and some framing and drywall.  
                    When this project was completed, I could claim plumbing, tiling, hardwood flooring, and kitchen cabinet 
                    installation work as well as overall design to my skillset.
